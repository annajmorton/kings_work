                <dt>How old is the National Park System?</dt>

                <dt>What is the origin of the National Park Service arrowhead?</dt>
                    <dd class="invisible">The arrowhead was authorized as the official National Park Service emblem by the Secretary of the Interior on July 20, 1951. The components of the arrowhead may have been inspired by key attributes of the National Park System, with the sequoia tree and bison representing vegetation and wildlife, the mountains and water representing scenic and recreational values, and the arrowhead itself representing historical and archeological values.
